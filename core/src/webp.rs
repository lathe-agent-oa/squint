//! WebP, which is a RIFF file: a twelve byte header and then a chain of chunks,
//! each one a four byte type, a little endian payload length, the payload, and a
//! pad byte when that length is odd.
//!
//! That chain is what makes this format unlike the ISOBMFF containers in `heif`,
//! and it decides how a strip works here. Nothing in a RIFF points at another
//! part of the file by offset — the single size field sits at the front and can
//! be recomputed from whatever is kept — so a dropped chunk genuinely leaves and
//! every chunk after it still reads. The file shrinks, which the overwrite-in-
//! place used for a HEIF never does.
//!
//! What must not happen is a length field being taken at its word. A length is
//! data like any other, and a file cut short in transit keeps its front intact
//! while its last chunk declares a payload that is not all there. A walk that
//! reads past the end, or that stops short of it, has not read this file, and
//! the answer is to refuse rather than to return the part it managed to reach.
